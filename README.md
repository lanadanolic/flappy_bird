The Flappy Bird game is a simple yet engaging project I recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This game challenges the player to navigate a bird through a series of obstacles without hitting them or falling to the ground.

How the game works:
Gameplay Mechanics:

The player controls a bird that automatically falls due to gravity.
By pressing a specific key, the bird "flaps" upward.
Pipes (or other obstacles) appear on the screen at regular intervals, with gaps that the bird must fly through.
Win/Loss Conditions:

The game ends if the bird:
Collides with a pipe.
Falls to the ground or flies out of bounds.
The player earns points for successfully passing through gaps in the pipes.
Features:

Increasing difficulty: The game speeds up or adds more challenging pipe placements as the player progresses.
Real-time score tracking displayed on the screen.
Responsive controls that ensure a smooth and engaging experience.
Implementation Details:

HTML: Defines the structure of the game, including the game container, bird, and obstacles.
CSS: Styles the game elements, such as the bird, pipes, and background, creating an appealing visual experience.
JavaScript: Handles the core game logic, including:
Gravity and flapping mechanics for the bird.
Pipe generation and movement.
Collision detection between the bird and obstacles.
Scoring and game-over events.
